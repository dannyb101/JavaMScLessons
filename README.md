# JavaMScLessons

This was a univeristy project where the tasks was to produce a command line educational resource for students studying Software Engineering.

The program starts with an initial welcome screen providing users with the option of completing lessons, reading through instructions on how to use the program and seeing a list of users who have compeleted lessons. Lessons are text based with a series of multiple choice questions at the end. Users need to achieve at least 50% in the quiz in order to pass the lesson. On passing the quiz users are required to input their name, which is the stored for later access. 

If you would like to run the solution please download RunMe.jar and run the file at the command line using: java -jar RunMe.jar
